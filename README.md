#programmingproblems

My personal solutions for various programming problems I find such as:- 

 Project Euler: https://projecteuler.net <br/>
 HackerRank: https://www.hackerrank.com/domains

Each problem implements the a *Problem interface meaning they can all be called the same way to simple return the answer as a number/string.
Every Problem/Question is then a class with the problem statement in it's class JavaDoc.  Those which I have solved also contain the final answer if the problem has set data, ideally these would be in accompanying unit tests, which I may add later.
