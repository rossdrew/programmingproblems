#programmingproblems

My personal solutions for various programming problems I find.  Each problem source is in it's own package with it's own README.md description.  Some locations I plan to also look at are...

 Sphere Online Judge: http://www.spoj.com<br/>
 CoderByte : http://coderbyte.com<br/>
 CodeWars : http://www.codewars.com/?language=java<br/>
 RosettaCode : http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code<br/>

<h3>Other Avenues</h3>
 Some avenues for code exercise which may or be not be commitable:-<br/>
 <br/>
 Eudyptula Challenge (Linux Kernel) : http://eudyptula-challenge.org/

<h3>Current Sources</h3>

 The current sources I use are of different levels of difficulties and require different time commitments.  I try to do a little coding every day here so quick problems are handy when I'm busy, long problems when I have much more time to spare.<br/>
 <br/>
 Coding Bat - Single method, < 5 minute problems.<br/>
 Euler - Project Euler is a bit more involved, requiring some thought, time and average amount of code.<br/>
 CodeEval - Requires probably not as much thought but more boiler plate code than Euler as the actual code is sumbmitted.<br/>
 TopCoder - Much more involved coding, often requiring more advanced algorithms and data structures.<br/>
 Google Foobar - Level (1-5) based, difficulty increasing coding challenges by [Google](http://www.google.com/).
