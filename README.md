# Programming Problems

My personal solutions for various programming problems I find.  Each problem source is in it's own package with it's own README.md description.  Some locations I plan to also look at are...

 - [Sphere Online Judge](http://www.spoj.com)
 - [CoderByte](http://coderbyte.com)
 - [CodeWars](http://www.codewars.com/?language=java)
 - [RosettaCode](http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Rosetta_Code)
 - [InterviewCake](https://www.interviewcake.com/question/stock-price)
 - [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
 - [CodeChef](https://www.codechef.com/) 


### Other Avenues
 Some avenues for code exercise which may or be not be commitable:-
 
 - [Eudyptula Challenge (Linux Kernel)](http://eudyptula-challenge.org/)
 - [Matasano Crypto Challenges](http://www.matasano.com/articles/crypto-challenges/)

### Current Sources

 The current sources I use are of different levels of difficulties and require different time commitments.  I try to do a little coding every day here so quick problems are handy when I'm busy, long problems when I have much more time to spare.
 - [CodingBat](https://github.com/rossdrew/programmingproblems/tree/master/src/main/java/com/rox/prob/codingbat) - Single method, < 5 minute problems.
 - [Euler](https://github.com/rossdrew/programmingproblems/tree/master/src/main/java/com/rox/prob/euler) - Project Euler is a bit more involved, requiring some thought, time and average amount of code.
 - [CodeEval](https://github.com/rossdrew/programmingproblems/tree/master/src/main/java/com/rox/prob/codeeval) - Requires probably not as much thought but more boiler plate code than Euler as the actual code is submitted.
 - [TopCoder](https://github.com/rossdrew/programmingproblems/tree/master/src/main/java/com/rox/prob/topcoder) - Much more involved coding, often requiring more advanced algorithms and data structures.
 - Google Foobar - Level (1-5) based, difficulty increasing coding challenges by [Google](http://www.google.com/) - A festive challenge running two similar challenges every day in December.  Ranging from simple to relatively complex.
 - [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com)
