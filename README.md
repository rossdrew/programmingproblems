My personal solutions for Project Euler problems found at https://projecteuler.net

Each problem implements the Problem interface meaning they can all be called the same way to simple return the answer as a number.
Every Problem is then a class with the problem statement in it's class JavaDoc.  Those which I have solved also contain the final answer, ideally these would be in accompanying unit tests, which I may add later.
