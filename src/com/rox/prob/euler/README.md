Project Euler Problems
https://projecteuler.net/

<i>Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems.</i>

<h3>My Solutions</h3>

Each problem implements the a *Problem interface meaning they can all be called the same way to simple return the answer as a number/string.
Every Problem/Question is then a class with the problem statement in it's class JavaDoc.  Those which I have solved also contain the final answer if the problem has set data, ideally these would be in accompanying unit tests, which I may add later.
