# CodeEval

Solutions from the 'easy' category on [CodeEval](https://www.codeeval.com/)

This site has some annoying quirks.  It is evaluated online and therefore the online
editor has to be used so only one class allowed and it needs to be called 'Main'
without a package.
This caused me to fail my first few goes, having forgotten to rename my class then
remove the package name.
