## Advent of Code

This is a yearly challenge published by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/) on [AdventOfCode.com](http://adventofcode.com) described as :-
 
 "_a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels. They are self-contained and are just as appropriate for an expert who wants to stay sharp as they are for a beginner who is just learning to code. Each puzzle calls upon different skills and has two parts that build on a theme._"
 
 It works much like -as the name would suggest- an advent calender, in which a new challenge is available for each day of Christmas.
